# Classic Algorithms in Rust

This repo contains the implementation of various classic algorithms for
educational purposes in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Right now, it is
in its early stages, but the plan is to include a comprehensive list of
algorithms. Contributions are welcome!

The main goal right now is to match the current algorithms implemented in
https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Rust.

## Setup

This repo is only for educational purposes. It is meant to be used as a
reference material. Thus, it is written as a library instead of a binary.

The way to check the execution of an algorithm is running the tests,
which you can do using:

```bash
cargo test
```
