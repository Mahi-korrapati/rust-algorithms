### [Bogo Sort](./bogo_sort.rs)

From [Wikipedia][bogosort-wiki]: In computer science, bogosort (also known as permutation sort, stupid sort, slowsort or bozosort) is a sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm. The function successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. It is not considered useful for sorting, but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with more efficient algorithms.

Two versions of this algorithm exist: a deterministic version that enumerates all permutations until it hits a sorted one,and a randomized version that randomly permutes its input. An analogy for the working of the latter version is to sort a deck of cards by throwing the deck into the air, picking the cards up at random, and repeating the process until the deck is sorted. Its name is a portmanteau of the words bogus and sort.

### [Bucket_Sort](./bucket_sort.rs)

From [Wikipedia][bucketsort-wiki]: Bucket sort, or bin sort, is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. It is a distribution sort, a generalization of pigeonhole sort that allows multiple keys per bucket, and is a cousin of radix sort in the most-to-least significant digit flavor. Bucket sort can be implemented with comparisons and therefore can also be considered a comparison sort algorithm. The computational complexity depends on the algorithm used to sort each bucket, the number of buckets to use, and whether the input is uniformly distributed.

Bucket sort works as follows:

Set up an array of initially empty "buckets".
Scatter: Go over the original array, putting each object in its bucket.
Sort each non-empty bucket.
Gather: Visit the buckets in order and put all elements back into the original array.

Optimization:
A common optimization is to put the unsorted elements of the buckets back in the original array first, then run insertion sort over the complete array; because insertion sort's runtime is based on how far each element is from its final position, the number of comparisons remains relatively small, and the memory hierarchy is better exploited by storing the list contiguously in memory.

If the input distribution is known or can be estimated, buckets can often be chosen which contain constant density (rather than merely having constant size). This allows O(n) average time complexity even without uniformly distributed input.

### [Bubble Sort](./bubble_sort.rs)

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

1. First Iteration (Compare and Swap)

* Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.
* If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.
* Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order.
* The above process goes on until the last element.

2. Remaining Iteration

* The same process goes on for the remaining iterations.
* After each iteration, the largest element among the unsorted elements is placed at the end.
* In each iteration, the comparison takes place up to the last unsorted element.
* The array is sorted when all the unsorted elements are placed at their correct positions.

### [Cocktail_Shaker_Sort](./cocktail_shaker_sort.rs)

Cocktail Shaker Sort, also called bidirectional bubble sort, iterates through a list from top to bottom and then from bottom to top. It is highly performant when the items in the list are partially sorted. The complexity of any list is O(n^2), but it approaches O(n) if the distance of each item from its final position in the ordered list is relatively small.

### [Comb_Sort](./comb_sort.rs)

Comb Sort is another optimization of Bubble Sort, and achieves this by eliminating small values towards the end of the list. It also uses a shrink-factor (k), which is used in the inner loop of Bubble Sort that performs the swapping of elements. The gap between elements that are compared in Bubble Sort is always 1, but the Comb Sort allows for the gap to be larger than 1 and then shrink by (k) for each iteration. (k) highly affects the efficiency of the algorithm, and is ideal at 1.3.

__Properties__
* Best time Complexity : O(n)
* Worst time Complexity: O(n^2)

### [Quick Sort](./quick_sort.rs)

QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are 4 common ways of selecting a pivot:

* Pick the first element
* Pick the last element
* Pick a random element
* Pick the median element

The key process in quickSort is a partition(). The target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of an array as the pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.

### [Selection Sort](./selection_sort.rs)

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. 

The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

* The subarray which already sorted. 
* The remaining subarray was unsorted.

In every iteration of the selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

### [Heap Sort](./heap_sort.rs)

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. The main idea behind heap sort is to turn the array into a max-heap structure, which ensures that the largest element of the heap is located at the root. This largest element is then swapped with the last element and removed from the heap. This process is repeated until the heap is empty, resulting in a sorted array.

* Safety: One of Rust's main features is memory safety. In the heap sort implementation, Rust ensures safety by using borrowing and the slice notation to manipulate parts of the array.
* In-place Swapping: Rust provides an efficient way to swap two elements in an array with arr.swap(i, j), which makes the algorithm elegant and concise.
* Performance: Rust, being a systems programming language, ensures that the heap sort implementation is efficient and can be optimized further by the Rust compiler.

__Properties__
* In-place sorting: It sorts the data in place, requiring only a constant amount of additional memory.
* Time complexity: Heap sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).

### [Odd-Even Sort](./odd_even_sort.rs)

Odd-Even Sort, also known as Brick Sort, is a relatively simple sorting algorithm, inspired by the idea behind Bubble Sort. The main idea is to repeatedly make two passes on an array: one for every odd-indexed element pair and the other for every even-indexed element pair.

__Algorithm__
* Odd Step: Compare all odd-indexed elements of the array with their next neighbor (i.e., at index i and i+1) and swap them if the element at index i is greater than the one at i+1.
* Even Step: Compare all even-indexed elements of the array with their next neighbor (i.e., at index i and i+1) and swap them if the element at index i is greater than the one at i+1.
* Repeat the two steps until the array is sorted.

__Properties__

* Best case : O(n)
* Average case : O(n^2)

### [Pancake Sort](./pancake_sort.rs)

The main operation in Pancake Sort is a "flip" operation. Given an integer k, the flip operation reverses the order of the first k elements in the array.

The idea behind Pancake Sort:

* Find the index of the maximum element in the array.
* Use the flip operation to move this maximum element to the beginning of the array.
* Use another flip operation to move this maximum element to its correct position at the end of the array.
* Exclude the last element and repeat the above steps for the rest of the array.

The goal is to move the largest unsorted element to its correct position in each iteration.

__Properties__
* Worst case : O(n^2)
* Average case : O(n^2)

### [Merge Sort](./merge_sort.rs)

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It works as follows:

* Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element.
* Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.

* The merge_sort function first checks if the array has a length of 1 or 0. If so, it's already sorted, so it returns the array as-is.
* The array is split into two halves, which are recursively sorted.
* The sorted halves are merged together using the merge function.
* The merge function takes two sorted arrays (or slices) and returns a new array that contains all the elements from both arrays in sorted order. It does this by iterating through both arrays simultaneously, always choosing the smallest of the two current elements to append to the result.

__Properties__
* Worst case : O(nlogn)
* Average case : O(nlogn)
* Best case : O(nlogn)

### [Insertion Sort](./insertion_sort.rs)

Insertion sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It's best suited for small arrays or arrays that are already nearly sorted.

The basic idea of insertion sort is similar to the way many people sort playing cards in their hands. We start from the beginning of the array and continuously insert elements in their correct position in the sorted portion of the array.

Here's a step-by-step explanation followed by a Rust implementation:

* Start from the second element (index 1) assuming the element at index 0 is sorted.
* Compare the current element with the previous elements. If the current element is smaller than the previous element, we keep comparing with the elements before until we reach an element smaller or reach the start of the array.
* Insert the current element in its correct position so that the elements before are all smaller than the current element.
* Repeat the process for each of the elements in the array.

__Properties__
* Worst case : O(n^2)
* Average case : O(n^2)
* Best case : O(n)

__Space Complexity__
* O(1) - Because it's an in-place sorting algorithm (i.e., it doesn't require any additional storage).
